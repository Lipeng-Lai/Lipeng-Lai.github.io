      <description>&amp;ldquo;I unexpectedly met you during a rather troubled period of time. The dormitory lights were already out, yet there I was, as usual, hiding under my blanket, peering into others&amp;rsquo; lives. It was the first time I stayed up so late, but I felt strangely content.
After the initial excitement of our online interactions passed, summer came, and due to distance and other distractions, our communication dwindled. My once interesting stories seemed depleted, and I grew somewhat fearful, feeling unreal and elusive.</description>

      <description>While the pensioner of Ghent and his eminence were exchanging very low bows and a few words in voices still lower, a man of lofty stature, with a large face and broad shoulders, presented himself, in order to enter abreast with Guillaume Rym; one would have pronounced him a bull-dog by the side of a fox. His felt doublet and leather jerkin made a spot on the velvet and silk which surrounded him.</description>

      <description>Illustration from Victor Hugo et son temps (1881) The Hunchback of Notre-Dame (French: Notre-Dame de Paris) is a French Romantic/Gothic novel by Victor Hugo, published in 1831. The original French title refers to Notre Dame Cathedral, on which the story is centered. English translator Frederic Shoberl named the novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame in 1833 because at the time, Gothic novels were more popular than Romance novels in England.</description>
