    As the night was fast falling, and as the moon, being past the full, would not rise early. We held a little council, a short one, for dearly our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could find. So, they plied their oars once more, and I looked out for anything like a house. Thus we held on, speaking little, for four or five dull miles. It was very cold, and, a collier coming by us, with her gallery-fire smoking and faring, looked like a comfortable home.

    The most loved place, for me, in this country has in fact been many places. It has changed throughout the years, as 1 and my circumstances have changed. I haven&rsquo;t really lost any of the best places from the past, though. I may no longer inhabit them, but they inhabit me, portions of memory, presences in the mind. My best place at the moment is very different, although I guess it has some of the attributes of that long ago place.

    &ldquo;I unexpectedly met you during a rather troubled period of time. The dormitory lights were already out, yet there I was, as usual, hiding under my blanket, peering into others&rsquo; lives. It was the first time I stayed up so late, but I felt strangely content.
After the initial excitement of our online interactions passed, summer came, and due to distance and other distractions, our communication dwindled. My once interesting stories seemed depleted, and I grew somewhat fearful, feeling unreal and elusive.
